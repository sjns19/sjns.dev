						As a self-taught person, I started to learn coding in 2013 with a <Link href="https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm" className="link" title="PAWN language" target="_blank">language called PAWN</Link>, which
						is used by a <Link href="https://www.sa-mp.mp/" className="link" title="GTA San Andreas Multiplayer" target="_blank">game&apos;s multiplayer platform</Link> as the scripting language for its servers. Eventually prompting me to create <Link href="https://github.com/sjns19/samp-cod-wg/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file" className="link" title="Click to view repository" target="_blank">a server gamemode</Link> for my own community.
						This initial experience opened the doors for me to enter the world of programming.
						In 2016, I shifted my focus towards web development, which has now become my main area of interest.

						I do web development and write blog posts, sharing the knowledge that I have gained in order to help others.

						Apart from coding, I also do pencil sketches alongside graphics design to some extent, although I&apos;m not a
						professional. My preferred approach for this field has always been improvisation.
